                    <p>For the token, what we'd like to do is have neither too large nor too small a supply.</p>

                        The main idea is that the tokenomics should be understood by everyone. It's essential to have
                        non-complex tokenomics so that all users know what they're buying. Don't include unnecessary
                        actors and align all stakeholders equally.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div className='blog-paragraph-container'>
                    <p>
                        Not all tokens have the same appreciation, listings, or timing. There are many factors we don't
                        control, so the goal is to create good tokenomics.
                    </p>

                <div className='blog-paragraph-container'>
                    <p>
                        Because price is psychological - having a token that appreciates... altcoins are the last thing
                        people buy and the first line to disappear, justifiably so, so we'll see.
                    </p>

                        Psychologically, price is everything. We see this in traditional finance where stocks split when
                        they rise too high, as we've seen with Apple, Nvidia, and many others. After that, it depends on
                        which direction we want the token to go.

                        To make the proposition viable, we need the means in terms of revenue, maturity, market share,
                        etc., to enable the proposition to be considered. There's no point in asking people to buy PRK
                        if the protocol doesn't make money. We shouldn't be in a situation where we're declaring
                        economic activity that isn't real, living on subsidies, etc. We need to be in a real economic
                        activity where the protocol's net profits are used to buy PRK on secondary markets and also
                        distribute protocol revenue to PRK stakers. We should add other utilities like fee reduction
                        with payment of swaps, bridges, P2P in PRK - essentially, having the capabilities to make it
                        happen.

                    <p>And the token should have utility. Having a decentralized structure remains most important.</p>
